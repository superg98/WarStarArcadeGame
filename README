Hello!

This project is being made as a fun side-project to Anna Brogowski's studies.
None of this work intends to infringe on any copyright claims, it is purely for fun and education of using Python and
GitHub pushing/fetching commands. However, this is heavily based off the 1983 Star Wars arcade game. An example of the
gameplay can be seen here, on Galactic Voyage's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzGWEYCRA0w

If you intend to run the game to test it (once it's finished), you'll download the files for this project and run
the .exe file it comes with. From there, you should be able to play through a few levels of the game.

May the Force be with you!
